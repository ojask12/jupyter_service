# SOP Management System - Problem Statement & Wireframe Requirements

## Problem Statement

### What Are SOPs and Why Do They Matter?

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are step-by-step instructions that tell employees exactly how to do their work correctly and safely. Think of them as recipe books for business processes - they ensure everyone follows the same method, reducing errors and maintaining quality.

**Example**: A factory worker needs to know the exact steps to safely operate a machine. A call center agent needs the procedure for handling customer complaints. A hospital nurse needs the protocol for patient discharge.

### The Current Problems

Right now, most organizations struggle with five major issues when managing their SOPs:

#### 1. **"I Can't Find It When I Need It"**
**The Problem**: Employees need SOPs while they're working - on the factory floor, at a customer site, or from home. But SOPs are often stored in:
- Separate systems that require different passwords
- Network drives that aren't accessible from mobile devices
- Email attachments that get lost
- Paper binders that are outdated

**Real Impact**: A worker on the factory floor can't access the safety procedure on their phone. They either guess what to do (risky!) or stop work to find a computer (inefficient!).

#### 2. **"Which Version Is Correct?"**
**The Problem**: SOPs get updated frequently, but old versions keep circulating. Employees end up with:
- Multiple versions of the same SOP (which one is current?)
- Different versions for different roles or locations (hard to know which applies to you)
- Outdated procedures that cause mistakes

**Real Impact**: Employee A follows Version 2.0, Employee B follows Version 3.0, and Employee C follows Version 1.5. They all think they're doing it right, but they're doing different things!

#### 3. **"Nobody Told Me It Changed"**
**The Problem**: When SOPs are updated:
- Policy owners forget to notify everyone
- Notifications get lost in email
- It's unclear which changes are important enough to announce
- Employees don't know what changed or why

**Real Impact**: A critical safety procedure was updated last month, but half the team is still following the old (unsafe) version because they never got notified.

#### 4. **"How Do We Prove Compliance?"**
**The Problem**: Organizations need to prove to auditors (like ISO certification bodies) that:
- Employees have read the required SOPs
- Employees understand the procedures
- The organization is managing SOPs properly

**Current Reality**: No easy way to track who read what, when they read it, or if they understood it. Audits become stressful guessing games.

#### 5. **"Who's Responsible for This?"**
**The Problem**: SOPs are owned by different people across the organization:
- When someone leaves, their SOPs get forgotten
- When a team owns an SOP, nobody feels personally responsible
- Review deadlines get missed
- Updates pile up and never get done

**Real Impact**: An important SOP hasn't been updated in 3 years because the original owner left, and nobody knows who should update it now.

### What We Need

A system that solves all these problems by:
- Making SOPs easy to find and access from anywhere, on any device
- Keeping only the current, correct version visible to each employee
- Automatically notifying the right people when things change
- Tracking who read what and proving compliance automatically
- Making it clear who owns each SOP and when it needs updating
